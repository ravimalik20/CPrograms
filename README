Programs encountered while learning C

Hello friends,

I am a beginner in Programing. Although i have a moderate experience in programing with python, i consider my programing knowledge at the beginner stage. 
It is fairly recent that i have realised the importance of C language and the importance of learning about the core functioning of the computer.
And here i am trying to learn both of these from the resources that i have, books and THE INTERNET.
I am presently learning C from "C Programing A Modern Approach.. by K.N.King" and find this book simply awesome. No book that i have read befor for C matches the excellence of this book.
And i encounter some concepts and programs in the book which are too good to understand the depths of the language.
So i decided to have a collection of these concepts and programs so that i could revisit them at leisure.
I also feel that these should be shared with everyone so that others could benefit from my learning experiences.

WARNING:

The programs that i have added might look very obvious and simple to some. I add them because these were the concepts which i previously had difficulty in understanding or are very intreaguing. 

Keep in mind that every professional starts as a beginer and once we do become profesionals we usually forget how it used to feel like a beginner.

I hope that my collection will benefit budding programmers as it is definitely helping me.
